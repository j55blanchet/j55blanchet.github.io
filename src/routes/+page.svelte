    <p class="">
        I'm a creative technologist. I'm currently in my 5th year pursuing a PhD Student in computer science at Dartmouth College, advised by <a href="https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/devin/">Prof. Devin Balkcom</a>.         
    </p>
    <p class="">
        Before this, I've worked as a high school teacher, software lead at a startup, and software engineer at Microsoft.
        
        I'm passionate about creating immersive experiences that inspire wonder, help people learn new skills, and connect people together in authentic ways.
