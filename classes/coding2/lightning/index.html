                <h4>Lightning - Simple</h4>
                <p>This covers the essentials. When the user clicks their mouse, a lightning bolt is drawn through it.</p>
                <h6>Notes</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>The shape of the lightening bolt changes every time the mouse is clicked or moved</li>
                    <li>The bolt persists as long as the mouse location stays the same</li>
                    <li>When the mouse is released, the bolt fades out (optional)</li>
                    <li>I recommend using <code>beginShape()</code>, <code>vertex(x, y)</code>, and <code>endShape()</code> to accomplish this.</li>

                <h4>Lightning - Buzzing</h4>
                <p>A little more advanced. Adds a few effects to make the ligthning bolts more "static-y"</p>
                <h6>Notes</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>As the mouse is held down, the bolt "buzzes" by randomly adding or subtracting a few pixels to the x location of each vertex that is drawn</li>
                    <li>Also, the strokeWeight is randomly varied between 2 and 5</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Lightning - Full Scene</h4>
                <p>Lightning looks even cooler when integrated into a scene!</p>
                <h6>Notes</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>The bolts emerge from beneath the clouds</li>
                    <li>This one has been modified to initiate lightning automatically at random times.</li>
                    <li>A lightning bolts persists a few frames before being erased, during which it buzzes</li>
                    <li>When the lightning bolt is being drawn, the fill color of the pumpkin is altered to a much brighter color, creating a "lit-by-lightning" effect.</li>
