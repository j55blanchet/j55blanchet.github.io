I'm Jules <aside class="badge badge-neutral">She/Her</aside></h1> <p>I'm a creative technologist. I'm currently in my 5th year pursuing a PhD Student in the <a href="https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/home/">Robotics &amp; Reality Lab</a> at Dartmouth College, advised by <a href="https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/devin/">Prof. Devin Balkcom</a>.</p> <p>I've taken circuitous path getting to this point - since graduating from Dartmouth in 2015 with a computer science major and education minor, I've worked as an software engineer at a large tech company (Microsoft) and small farming-technology startup (<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2015/mit-startup-grove-labs-brings-urban-agriculture-indoors-1110">Grove Labs</a>), and then as a high school teacher (<a href="https://winchendon.org/">The Winchendon School</a>). In 2019, I returned to Dartmouth to pursue a PhD in Computer Science.</p> <p>My research interests lie primarily within the field of <strong>Human-Computer Interaction</strong>, incorporating elements of <strong>robotics</strong>, <strong>wearable devices</strong>, <strong>computer vision</strong>, and <strong>generative AI</strong>. Most of my current projects are focused on human motion teaching, flipping learning-by-demonstration on its head by using computers to teach us how to speak sign language, dance, and do yoga.</p> <p>I'm passionate about bridging the gap between the quantitative, logical world of computers and the rich, messy, beautiful nature of our lived experience. In my work, I seek to use technology to help us connect more deeply with our bodies, our creative nature, that inner spark that makes us human - and then support us in sharing that with others. I envision a future where technology supports us in being the best, happiest versions of ourselves.</p> <h4>Areas of Interest</h4> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-1"></div></article>`);function M(h){const c=[{title:"Human-Computer Interaction"},{title:"Movement Computing"},{title:"Ambient Computing"},{title:"Spatial Computing"},{title:"Robotics"}];var r=k(),n=d(p(r),12);y(n,5,()=>c,w,(l,e)=>{var t=x();let s;var m=p(t,!0);o(t),f(g=>{s=I(t,1,"badge",null,s,g),v(m,a(e).title)},[()=>({"badge-primary":a(e).type==="primary","badge-neutral":a(e).type===void 0||a(e).type==="neutral"})],b),i(l,t)}),o(n),o(r),i(h,r)}export{M as component};
